# mincost_traveltour
 
 The program uses input information which includes the travel and living cost to generate the most economic travel plan. Two available settings are with and without the one-time visit requirment (a destination can only be visited once). 
 
 Assumptions of the model are:
 
 1. Traveller starts at a starting location, travel through n destinations/cities, and then come back to the starting location. For example, a tour from Albion through LA, TOR, and NYC will be Albion - LA - TOR - NYC - Albion.
 2. All the cost (travel + living) are known within the interested timeframe.
 3. Only one new destination can be visited in any given day.
 4. There is a desired duration of stay in each destination.

Example input are provided in the .txt file
